\noindent \emph{Motivated and independent mathematician with broad interests in technical fields including data science, open source software, and science education.}

Andrew is \textbf{technically minded} and grasps abstract concepts quickly. By achieving a fundamental understanding of abstract notions, he is able to \textbf{communicate these ideas clearly} and effectively.
\\
\indent Andrew is at the cutting edge of research on \emph{support variety theory}. By engrossing himself in this mathematical research, he develops skills that allow him to \textbf{learn and apply} technical disciplines with grace.
\\
\indent Andrew has educated many students through TAships, private tutoring, and serving as instructor of record. By teaching a broad array of courses, he has honed his communication skills. He is
 \textbf{comfortable explaining technical concepts} in both one-on-one settings and in a lecture setting.

Andrew is looking for a \textbf{data based summer internship} where he can use his technical skills to \textbf{do meaningful work}.
